Code from the paper "Sensitivity to Unobserved Confounding in Studies with Factor-structured Outcomes"
Arxiv preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06552

### Figures from the Main Paper
- Code to generate Figures 1a and 1b from Section 4 of the paper can be found in `simulation/simulation.Rmd`
- Code to generate Figure 2 from Section 6 can be found in `NHANES_analysis/NHANES_analysis.Rmd`

### Figures and Tables from the Appendix

Appendix Tables 1 and 2 and Appendix Figures 3 and 4 are both included in `NHANES_analysis/NHANES_analysis.Rmd`.

### General functions
Code to compute bounds and generate plots can be found in `utility_functions.R`.  These functions are called from both Rmds.  We briefly describe some of these core functions here.
