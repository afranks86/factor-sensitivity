### Causal Inference From Observational Data

- Consider a treatment $T$ and outcome $Y$

- Interested in the population average treatment effect (PATE) of $T$ on $Y$:
$$E[Y | do(T=t)] - E[Y | do(T=t')]$$ 

. . .

- In general, the PATE is not the same as $$E[Y | T=t] - E[Y | T=t']$$

## Confounders

<center>![](confounder){width="50%"}</center>

<center>Need to control for $U$ to consistently estimate the causal effect</center>

## Confounding bias

- Observed data regression of $T$ on $Y$ fails because the distribution of $U$ varies in the two treatment arms

. . . 

- We try to condition on as many *observed* confounders as possible to mitigate potential confounding bias 

. . . 

- Commonly assumed that there are "no unobserved confounders" (NUC) but this is unverifiable

. . .

- Sensitivity analysis is a tool for assessing the impacts of violations of this assumption

### The Effects of Light Alcohol Consumption

- Observational data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES) on alcohol consumption. 



- Light alcohol consumption is positively correlated with blood levels of HDL ("good cholesterol") 

. . .

- Define "light alcohol consumption'' as 1-2 alcoholic beverages per day 

- Non-drinkers: self-reported drinking of one drink a week or less 

- Control for age, gender and indicator for educational attainment

## HDL and alcohol consumption

```{r}
X <- read_csv("NHANES_predictors.csv") %>% as.matrix
Y <- read_csv("NHANES_outcomes.csv") %>% as.matrix 
Y <- apply(Y, 2, function(x) x/sd(x))
drinking <- X[, 1]
X <- X[, -1]
```

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lm(Y[, "HDL"] ~ drinking + X))
```

. . .

<br>

<center>What must be true for this correlation to be non-causal?</center>

---

### Blood mercury and alcohol consumption

```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary(lm(Y[, "Methylmercury"] ~ drinking + X))
```

. . .

<br>

<center>But... no plausible causal mechanism in this case</center>

## Residual Correlation

```{r, echo=TRUE}
#| code-line-numbers: "|4"
#| output-location: fragment
hdl_fit <- lm(Y[, "HDL"] ~ drinking + X)
mercury_fit <- lm(Y[, "Methylmercury"] ~ drinking + X)

cor.test(hdl_fit$residuals, mercury_fit$residuals)

```

. . . 

<br>
Residual correlation might be indicative of confounding bias

## Sensitivity Analysis

- NUC unlikely to hold exactly.  What then?

- Calibrate assumptions about confounding to explore range of causal effects that are plausible

- Robustness: quantify how "strong" confounding has to be to nullify causal effect estimates

## Multi-outcome Sensitivity Analysis

- Can prior knowledge in the multi-outcome setting be leveraged to strengthen causal conclusions?

. . .

- What does residual correlation in multi-outcome models mean for potential for confounding?

. . .

- How do results change when we assume a priori that certain outcomes cannot be effected by treatments?
  
  + Null control outcomes (e.g. alcohol consumption should not increase mercury levels)

## Standard Assumptions

::: {.callout-caution}
## Assumption (Latent Ignorability)
U and X block all backdoor paths between T and Y [@pearl2009causality]
:::

::: {.callout-caution }
## Assumption (Latent positivity)
f(T = t | U = u, X = x) > 0 for all u and x
:::

::: {.callout-caution}
## Assumption (SUTVA)
There are no hidden versions of the treatment and there is no
interference between units
:::


## Single-outcome Sensitivity Analysis

:::{.callout-note icon=false}
## Result [@cinelli2020making]
Assume the outcome is linear in the treatment and confounders (no interactions). Then the squared omitted variable bias for the PATE is
$$\text{Bias}_{t_1,t_2}^2 
        \, \leq \, 
        \frac{(t_1-t_2)^2}{\sigma_{t\mid x}^2} \left(\frac{R^2_{T\sim U|X}}{1 - R^2_{T\sim U|X}}
        \right)R^2_{Y \sim U | T, X}$$
:::

. . .

- $R^2_{T\sim U|X}$: partial fraction of treatment variance explained by confounders (given observed covariates)

. . .

- $R^2_{Y\sim U|T,X}$: partial fraction of outcome variance explained by confounders (given observed covariates and treatment)

## Robustness

- How big do $R^2_{T\sim U |X}$ and $R^2_{Y \sim U | T, X}$ need to be to nullify the effect?

. . . 

- $RV^1$ smallest value of $R^2_{T\sim U |X} = R^2_{Y \sim U | T, X}$ needed to nullify effect [@cinelli2020making]

. . . 

- $XRV$ smallest value of $R^2_{T\sim U |X}$ assuming $R^2_{Y \sim U | T, X}=1$ needed to nullify effect [@cinelli2022iv]

## Calibrating Sensitivity Parameters

- What values of $R^2_{Y\sim U|T, X}$ and $R^2_{T \sim U | X}$ might be reasonable?

- Can use observed covariates to generate benchmark values:

  + Compute $R^2_{T \sim X_{j} | X_{-j}}$ for all covariate $X_j$

  + Compute $R^2_{Y \sim X_{j} | X_{-j}, T}$ for all covariate $X_j$
  
- Use domain knowledge to reason about most important confounders

## Models with factor-structured residuals

<br>
Assume the **observed data** mean and covariance can be expressed as follows:
$$\begin{align}
    E[Y \mid T = t, X=x] &= \check g(t, x)\\
    Cov(Y \mid T = t, X = x) &= \Gamma\Gamma' + \Lambda,
\end{align}$$

- $\Gamma$ are factor loading matrices, $\Lambda$ is diagonal

. . .

- $\check g(T=t, X) - \check g(T=t', X)$ is only the PATE when there is NUC

## A Structural Equation Model 

- $U$ (m-vector) and $X$ are possible causes for $T$ (scalar) and $Y$ (q-vector)

- $X$ are observed but $U$ are not.

$$\begin{align}
& U = \epsilon_U \label{eqn:u}\\
&T = f_{\epsilon}(X, U) \label{eqn:treatment_general,multi-y}\\
&Y = g(T,X) + \Gamma\Sigma_{u|t,x}^{-1/2}U + \epsilon_{y}, \label{eqn:epsilon_y}
\end{align}$$

. . .

- This SEM implies the factor structured residuals, $Cov(Y|T, X) = \Gamma\Gamma' + \Lambda$




## A Structural Equation Model

$$\begin{align}
&U = \epsilon_U\\
&T = f_\epsilon(X,U)\\
&Y = g(T, X) + \Gamma\Sigma_{u|t,x}^{-1/2}U + \epsilon_{y}
\end{align}$$

- Confounding bias is $\Gamma\Sigma_{u|t,x}^{-1/2}\mu_{u \mid t,x}$

- $\mu_{u \mid t,x}$ and $\Sigma_{u|t,x}$ are the conditional mean and covariance of the unmeasured confounders
  + User specified sensitivity parameters


## A Sensitivity Specification {.smaller}

- Interpretable specification for $\mu_{u \mid t,x}$ and $\Sigma_{u|t,x}$ parameterized by a single $m$-vector, $\rho$:

\begin{align}
\mu_{u\mid t,x} &= \frac{\rho}{\sigma_{t \mid x}^{2}}\left(t-\mu_{t\mid x}\right) \label{eqn:conditional_u_mean}, \\
\Sigma_{u \mid t,x} &= I_m-\frac{\rho \rho^{\prime}}{\sigma_{t\mid x}^{2}} \label{eqn:conditional_u_cov},
\end{align}

- $\rho$ is the partial correlation vector between $T$ and $U$

- $0 \leq R^2_{T \sim U |X}:= \frac{||\rho||^2_2}{\sigma^2_{t\mid x}} < 1$ is the squared norm of the partial correlation between T and U given $X$


## Multi-Outcome Assumptions
::: {.callout-caution}
## Assumption (Homoscedasticity)
$Cov(Y |T = t, X = x)$ is invariant to t and x. Implies factor loadings, $\Gamma$, are invariant to $t$ and $x$
:::

. . . 

::: {.callout-caution }
## Assumption (Factor confounding)
The factor loadings, $\Gamma$, are identifiable (up to rotation) and reflect all potential confounders. [@anderson1956statistical]
:::


To identify factor loadings, $\Gamma$, $(q-m)^2-q-m\geq0$ and each confounder must influence at least three outcomes

## Bounding the Omitted Variable Bias

::: {.callout-note icon=false}
## Theorem (Bounding the bias for outcome $Y_j$)
Given the structural equation model, sensitivity specification and given assumptions, the squared omitted variable bias for the PATE of outcome $Y_j$ is bounded by
$$\text{Bias}_{j}^2 
        \, \leq \, 
        \frac{(t_1-t_2)^2}{\sigma_{t\mid x}^2} \left(\frac{R^2_{T\sim U|X}}{1 - R^2_{T\sim U|X}}
        \right)\parallel \Gamma_j\parallel_2^2$$
:::

- The bound on the bias for outcome $j$ is proportional to the norm of the factor loadings for that outcome

- A single sensitivity parameter, $\rsqtx$, shared across all outcomes

## Null Control Outcomes

- Assume we have null control outcomes, $\mathcal{C}$
- $\check \tau$ are the vector of PATEs under NUC
- $\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}$ are the factor loadings for the null control outcomes, $\mathcal{C}$ 

. . .

- Need at least $\rsqtx \geq R^2_{min}$ of the treatment variance to be due to confounding to nullify the null controls

Assume the previous structural equation model and sensitivity specification.  Then the squared omitted variable bias for the PATE of outcome $Y_j$ is bounded by

    \text{Bias}_j \in 
    \left[\Gamma_j \Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}^{\dagger} \teNaiveNull

    \frac{R^2_{min}}{1 - R^2_{min}} 
    \right)}
\right],
\end{equation}
:::


- If $R^2_{T \sim U | X}=R^2_{min}$ then the bias is identified for all outcomes

- Ignorance about the bias is smallest when $\Gamma_j$ is close to the span of $\Gamma_{\mathcal{C}}$

## Robustness under Factor Confounding

- $RV^\Gamma_j$ smallest value of $R^2_{T\sim U |X}$ needed to nullify the effect for outcome $j$ under factor confounding

- $RV^\Gamma_j$ can be smaller or larger than $RV^1$

. . . 

- $RV^\Gamma_{j, NC}$ smallest value of $R^2_{T\sim U |X}$ needed to nullify the effect for outcome $j$ and the assumed null controls


## Simulation Study



- Gaussian data generating process 
\begin{align}
T &= \beta' U + \epsilon_T \\
Y_j &= \tau_jT + \Gamma'\Sigma^{-1/2}_{u|t}U + \epsilon_y
\end{align}

- $\rsqtx=0.5$ from $m=2$ unmeasured confounders

- $\tau_j = 0$ for $Y_1$, $Y_2$ and $Y_{10}$ 

- $\tau_j=1$ for all outher outcomes

## Simulation Study

- Fit a Bayesian linear regression on the 10 outcomes given then treatment

- Assume a residual covariance with a rank-two factor structure

- Plot ignorance regions assuming $R^2_{T \sim U} \leq 0.5$

- Plot ignorance regions assuming $R^2_{T \sim U} \leq 0.5$ and $Y_1$ is null

### The effects of light drinking {.smaller}

- Measure ten different outcomes from blood samples: 
  + natural: HDL, LDL, triglycerides, potassium, iron, sodium, glucose
  + environmental toxicants: mercury, lead, cadmium.

. . .

- Measured confounders: age, gender and indicator for highest educational attainment

. . .

- Residual correlation in the outcomes might be indicative of additional confounding bias

```{r}
X <- read_csv("NHANES_predictors.csv") %>% as.matrix
Y <- read_csv("NHANES_outcomes.csv") %>% as.matrix
drinking <- X[, 1]
X <- X[, -1]
```

## Aside: reparametrizing $R^2_{T \sim U | X}$

- $R^2_{T \sim U | X}$ is unnatural for binary treatments

- $\Lambda$-parameterization $\leftrightarrow$ $R^2_{T \sim U | X}$-parameterization

. . .

Fix a $\Lambda_\alpha$ such that
$$Pr\left(\Lambda_\alpha^{-1} \leq \frac{e_0(X, U)/(1-e_0(X, U))}{e(X)/(1-e(X))}\leq \Lambda_\alpha\right)=1-\alpha$$ 

- Related to the marginal sensitivity model [@tan2006distributional]

## Benchmark Values

- Use age, gender and an indicator of educational attainment to benchmark

- $\frac{1}{3.5} \leq \text{Odds}(X)/\text{Odds}(X_{-age}) \leq 3.5$ for 95% of observed values

- For gender and education indicators the odds change was between $\frac{1}{1.5}$ and $1.5$

- Assume light drinking has no effect on methylmercury levels

## Takeaways

- Prior knowledge unique to the multi-outcome setting can help inform assumptions about confounding

- Sharper sensitivity analysis, when assumptions hold

- Negative control assumptions can potentially provide strong evidence for or against robustness

## Future directions

- Identification with multiple treatments \emph{and} multiple outcomes 
  + Collaboration on effects of pollutants on multiple heath outcomes
  
- Sensitivity analysis for more general models / forms of dependence.
